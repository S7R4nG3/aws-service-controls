## Analysis and Changes Made:

### 1. Cloud Security Alliance (CSA) Cloud Controls Matrix
- **Version corrected**: Changed from "v5.0" to "v4.0.10" (current version)
- **Control titles updated** to match actual CSA CCM:
  - IAM-01: "Entitlement" (not "Identity and Access Management Policy and Procedures")
  - DSI-01: "Classification" (not "Data Security and Information Lifecycle Management")
  - EKM-01: "Entitlement" (not "Encryption Key Management")
  - SEF-01: "Timely Security Updates" (not "Security Event Logging")
- **Descriptions refined** to better align with actual CSA CCM control objectives

### 2. NIST 800-53 Rev 5
- **Control titles refined** for accuracy:
  - IA-2: Added "(Organizational Users)" specification
  - SI-4: "System Monitoring" (not "Information System Monitoring")
- **Descriptions enhanced** to include more specific NIST language about cryptographic mechanisms, auditable events, and monitoring objectives

### 3. AWS Security Hub
- **Framework name corrected**: "AWS Security Hub Security Standards" (more accurate than just "AWS Security Hub")
- **Version updated**: "3.0.0" (current version, not "2023.1")
- **CloudTrail.1 description enhanced** to be more specific about API calls and security monitoring context

### 4. Implementation Improvements
- Added more specific details about key rotation and access controls for EKM-01
- Enhanced logging descriptions to include retention and alerting considerations
- Improved CloudTrail.1 description to emphasize security monitoring and compliance aspects

The cost optimization section was accurate and required no changes.
