## Key Changes Made:

1. **CSA Cloud Controls Matrix**: Changed version from v5.0 to v4.0 (current version) and corrected control identifiers:
   - DSP-03 → DSI-01 (Data Loss Prevention)
   - IVS-06 → IVS-01 (Network Security) 
   - STA-09 → STA-04 (Audit Logging)
   - Updated AIS-01 title to match official framework

2. **AWS Foundational Security Best Practices**: 
   - Changed AutoScaling.1 severity from Critical to High
   - Added AutoScaling.9 which is a duplicate of AutoScaling.5 (both exist in the official framework)

3. **AWS Security Hub section**: Completely removed this framework as it's not a standalone security framework but rather a service that aggregates findings from other frameworks like AWS Foundational Security Best Practices

The corrections align the controls with their actual framework specifications and remove redundant or incorrect framework references.
