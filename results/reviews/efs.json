## Summary of Changes Made:

### NIST 800-53 Controls:
1. **AC-3**: Updated description to include the complete official description with "in accordance with applicable access control policies"
2. **AC-6**: Expanded description to include the full official wording about authorized accesses and organizational tasks
3. **AU-2**: Added "in support of the audit function" to match official control description
4. **AU-6**: Expanded description to include "potential impact of inappropriate or unusual activity"
5. **SC-7**: Added "and at key internal interfaces within the system" to match official control
6. **CP-9**: Updated to focus on "user-level information" as per official control definition

### CSA CCM Controls:
1. **Framework version**: Changed from "v5.0" to "v4.0" (v5.0 is not yet released)
2. **All control descriptions**: Updated to match the actual CSA CCM v4.0 format which includes "Policies and procedures shall be established, and supporting business processes and technical measures implemented"

### AWS Foundational Security Best Practices:
1. **EFS.1**: Updated title to include "using AWS KMS" and improved description specificity
2. **EFS.3 & EFS.4**: Changed severity from "LOW" to "MEDIUM" to match actual AWS standards
3. **All descriptions**: Enhanced to be more specific about what the controls actually check

### AWS Security Hub:
1. **EFS.3 & EFS.4**: Updated severity from "LOW" to "MEDIUM" to align with current AWS Security Hub findings classification

These changes ensure that all control descriptions, titles, and severities accurately reflect the official framework documentation and current AWS standards.
