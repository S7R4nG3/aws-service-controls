## Changes Made:

1. **Cloud Security Alliance Cloud Controls Matrix**:
   - Changed version from "v5" to "v4.0" (current version)
   - Adjusted severity levels from "Critical" to "High" for IAM controls and from "High" to "Medium" for DSI controls to match CCM guidelines

2. **NIST 800-53**:
   - Updated AU-6 title to the complete official title: "Audit Record Review, Analysis, and Reporting"
   - Updated SC-20 title to the complete official title: "Secure Name/Address Resolution Service (Authoritative Source)"

3. **AWS Foundational Security Best Practices**:
   - Removed this framework section entirely as it's not a standalone AWS framework - these controls are actually part of AWS Security Hub

4. **AWS Security Hub**:
   - Kept only the legitimate AWS Security Hub controls
   - Maintained the correct Route53.2 severity as "Low" (not "Medium" as in the duplicate section)

The cost optimization controls remain unchanged as they appear to be correctly formatted custom controls.
