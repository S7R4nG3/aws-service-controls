## Analysis of Discrepancies

Based on my analysis of the actual framework requirements, I identified several discrepancies:

### 1. NIST 800-53 Rev 5 Control AU-2
**Original:** Title was "Event Logging"
**Corrected:** Changed to "Audit Events" to match the actual NIST control definition

### 2. AWS Foundational Security Best Practices (FSBP) Identifiers
**Issue:** The original JSON used non-standard identifiers (Firehose.1-4)
**Corrected:** Changed to use the proper AWS Security Hub identifier "KinesisFirehose.1" which is the actual control that exists

### 3. Removed Non-Existent AWS FSBP Controls
**Issue:** Controls Firehose.2, Firehose.3, and Firehose.4 don't exist in the actual AWS FSBP standard
**Action:** Removed these fabricated controls and kept only the legitimate KinesisFirehose.1 control

### 4. AWS Security Hub Controls Cleanup
**Issue:** Some controls listed (KinesisFirehose.2-4) don't actually exist in AWS Security Hub
**Action:** Removed non-existent controls and kept only KinesisFirehose.1, which is the primary Firehose control in Security Hub

The corrected JSON now accurately reflects the actual framework requirements and removes any non-existent or incorrectly named controls while maintaining appropriate implementation guidance for AWS Data Firehose security controls.
