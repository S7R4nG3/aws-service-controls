## Summary of Key Changes Made:

### NIST SP 800-53 Changes:
- Changed AC-6 severity from Medium to High and implementation type from User to IaC to align with actual framework recommendations
- Enhanced descriptions with more specific AWS S3 implementation details

### CSA CCM Changes:
- Updated version from v4.0.6 to v4.0.10 (current version)
- Changed DSI-02 implementation type from User to Platform to leverage automated classification tools like Amazon Macie
- Enhanced EKM-01 with specific KMS requirements including customer-managed keys and rotation

### AWS Foundational Security Standard Changes:
- Updated control titles to match current AWS Security Hub standard format (added "general purpose buckets")
- Changed S3.8 severity from High to Medium to match actual AWS severity rating
- Enhanced S3.4 description to specify customer-managed keys for better security

### AWS Security Hub Changes:
- Updated all control titles to current format with "general purpose buckets"
- Changed S3.8 severity from High to Medium to match current AWS recommendations
- Updated implementation descriptions to be more specific about AWS services and capabilities

### Cost Optimization Changes:
- Updated COST-07 title and description to be more specific about storage class selection rather than just reserved capacity
- Enhanced implementations with more specific AWS services and features
- Added references to newer storage classes and optimization tools
