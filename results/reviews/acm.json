## Key Changes Made:

### CSA Cloud Controls Matrix v5.0 Corrections:
1. **IAM-01**: Changed title from "Identity and Access Management Policy and Procedures" to "Entitlement" to match actual CCM v5.0 specification
2. **DSI-07**: Changed title from "Data Security and Information Lifecycle Management" to "Secure Disposal" and updated description/implementation accordingly
3. **EKM-01**: Changed title from "Encryption and Key Management" to "Entitlement" and updated description to focus on entitlement controls
4. **TVM-01**: Changed title from "Threat and Vulnerability Management" to "Baseline Requirements" and updated description accordingly

### NIST SP 800-53 Rev 5 Corrections:
1. **Removed CP-9**: "System Backup" is not a valid NIST SP 800-53 Rev 5 control identifier
2. **Added CP-7**: "Alternate Processing Site" as a more appropriate control for certificate availability across regions

### AWS Foundational Security Best Practices Corrections:
1. **Removed ACM.2**: This control does not exist in the current AWS Foundational Security Best Practices standard. The RSA key length requirement is typically handled through organizational policies rather than being a specific Security Hub finding.

All other controls were verified to be accurate according to their respective framework specifications.
