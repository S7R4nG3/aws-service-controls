## Key Changes Made:

### CSA Cloud Controls Matrix:
1. **Version**: Updated from "v5.0" to "v4.0.10" (current stable version)
2. **CEK-01**: Changed identifier to "EKM-01" and title to "Encryption & Key Management"
3. **IAM-02**: Updated title from "User Access Provisioning" to "User Access Authorization"
4. **STA-01**: Updated title from "Security Testing & Audit" to "Security Testing"

### NIST 800-53:
1. **Framework name**: Corrected from "NIST 800-53" to "NIST SP 800-53"
2. **AU-6**: Updated title to include "Analysis, and Reporting"

### AWS Foundational Security Best Practices:
1. **Removed entire framework** - This framework doesn't exist as a standalone framework. The controls listed were actually from AWS Security Hub.
2. **EventBridge.1 and EventBridge.2**: These don't exist for EventBridge Scheduler specifically
3. **Moved relevant controls** to the AWS Security Hub section where they belong

### AWS Security Hub:
1. **Removed non-existent controls**: EventBridge.4 and EventBridge.5 don't exist for EventBridge Scheduler
2. **Updated control identifiers and titles** to match actual AWS Security Hub findings
3. **CloudWatch.1**: Updated to "CloudWatch.12" with corrected title about data retention policy
4. **IAM.1**: Updated title to be more specific about full administrative privileges

The corrected JSON now aligns with the actual framework specifications and removes controls that don't exist for AWS EventBridge Scheduler specifically.
