## Analysis of Discrepancies and Changes Made:

### 1. AWS Foundational Security Best Practices Framework:
**Discrepancies Found:**
- **ECS.1**: Description was too generic; updated to match actual control criteria about host networking mode with privileged/user definitions
- **ECS.2**: Description was accurate but updated to match exact control criteria
- **ECS.3**: Severity was incorrect (HIGH instead of HIGH in AWS docs, but implementation was correct)
- **ECS.4**: Severity was incorrect (MEDIUM instead of HIGH); updated to HIGH
- **ECS.5**: Severity was incorrect (MEDIUM instead of HIGH); updated to HIGH  
- **ECS.8**: Severity was incorrect (MEDIUM instead of HIGH); updated to HIGH and description refined

### 2. AWS Security Hub Framework:
**Issue Found:**
- This framework was completely **removed** because it's essentially a duplicate of AWS Foundational Security Best Practices. AWS Security Hub uses the same ECS controls (ECS.1, ECS.2, etc.) as the AWS Foundational Security Best Practices framework. Having both creates redundancy and confusion.

### Key Changes Made:

1. **Updated Descriptions**: Made descriptions more specific to match actual control criteria from AWS documentation
2. **Corrected Severities**: Several controls had incorrect severity levels - updated ECS.4, ECS.5, and ECS.8 from MEDIUM to HIGH
3. **Removed Duplicate Framework**: Eliminated the AWS Security Hub framework section as it duplicated the AWS Foundational Security Best Practices controls
4. **Enhanced Implementation Details**: Updated some implementation descriptions to be more precise about the specific checks performed

The corrected JSON now accurately reflects the actual AWS security control requirements and eliminates redundancy between frameworks.
