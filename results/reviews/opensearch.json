**Key changes made to resolve discrepancies:**

1. **CSA Cloud Controls Matrix v5.0 → v4.0.10**: Updated to current version
   - Changed DSI-01 to DSI-02 (Data Encryption in Storage) and DSI-07 (Data Encryption in Transit)
   - Updated IAM-01 title to "Entitlement"
   - Changed BCR-01 to BCR-03 "Information System Backup"

2. **NIST 800-53**: Updated control titles to match official names
   - CP-9: "Information System Backup" → "System Backup"
   - SI-4: "Information System Monitoring" → "System Monitoring"

3. **AWS Foundational Security Best Practices → AWS Foundational Security Standard**: Corrected framework name

4. **AWS Security Hub**: Removed this section as it duplicates AWS Foundational Security Standard controls and isn't a separate security framework - it's a service that aggregates findings from other standards
   - Moved OpenSearch.7 and OpenSearch.8 to AWS Foundational Security Standard
   - Updated severities to match AWS standards (Medium for most controls, Critical for VPC requirement)
   - Removed OpenSearch.9 as automatic snapshots are enabled by default and not a formal control

5. **Severity alignments**: Adjusted severities to match actual framework specifications

These changes align the JSON with the actual framework specifications and remove redundant controls while maintaining comprehensive coverage.
